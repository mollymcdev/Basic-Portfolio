            <p> My name is Molly McDevitt and I am a twenty year old beginning a fulfilling career in web
                development. I graduated from Portsmouth High School in 2016 and decided to forego the typical college
                route to instead travel and take more time to discover my true passions. After a year of splitting my
                time between travel and work, I decided to try my hand at different job opportunities, which eventually
                led me to a conversation with a family friend who has over twenty five years of experience as a woman
                in technology. The exchange sparked an interest and as I dove deeper into my research of the industry,
                I realized the incredible creative and professional opportunities available to full stack developers-
                and here we are!</p>

            <p> Outside of web development I enjoy reading, playing and writing music, poetry, yoga and being in
                nature. I believe that we are defined by our passions and our willingness to pursue them, and I am
                extremely excited to begin cultivating mine for web development!
